## What is Omen?

<strong><a href="https://omen.eth.limo/" target="_blank">Omen</a></strong> is a fully decentralized multi-chain prediction market platform built on the <a href="https://docs.gnosis.io/conditionaltokens/" target="_blank">Gnosis conditional token framework</a>. Users can create and/or participate in information markets on various topics (crypto, politics, sports, etc.) and stake their crypto on possible outcomes. 

When an Omen market reaches its closing date, anyone can start the process of crowdsourcing the search for the correct answer, made possible by <a href="https://reality.eth.limo/" target="_blank">reality.eth.limo</a>. In the event of a dispute, an arbitrator may be appointed to make a judgement.
