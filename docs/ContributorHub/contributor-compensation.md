# Contributor Compensation

___

## Compensation Structure

### Base Compensation in ETH or Stablecoins
Contributors may choose when to receive their ETH / Stablecoin payment in their contributor proposal.

### 50/50 Payment Structure

Often, contributors request 50% payment at the passing of their Alchemy proposal and the remaining 50% on the date that their contributor proposal period ends. However, this is not a fixed standard and may be requested differently depending on the circumstances. If you’re not requesting a 50/50 split, provide justification for a different payment structure and request feedback from community members.

### DXD Compensation on Top of Base Compensation
DXD is locked with ⅓ vesting after 1 year of the contributor contract start date, and the remaining ⅔ is vested through a linear schedule after the 1-year cliff, fully vested at 3 years. Contributors may not request liquid DXD in their contributor proposals.

### Determination of Price
ETH payment is determined by the price of ETH at the date and time of proposal submission. Because of the high volatility of ETH price, contributors may also determine the ETH payment based on the weekly average of the ETH price.
DXD payment is set to market price, determined by taking the average DXD price over the last 1 month in US dollars calculated on Swapr.

### REP
Contributors that commit at least 40 hours per week to DXdao receive 0.1667% REP per month. Contributors that are working less than 40 hours per week should calculate the amount of REP they receive in proportion to the amount of hours per week they contribute to DXdao. Like payments, REP is requested on a 50/50 basis, at the beginning of the work period and at the end of the work period in the contributor’s second payment request.

New contributors (3 month period): Like your salary, REP is calculated on a prorated basis. For the 1 month period, you may claim 0.08335% REP (50% rate). REP for the first two (2) months of work is prorated to an 80% rate at 0.1333% per month.

In the first contributor proposal on Alchemy, request 0.2167 % REP for your first two months of work.
In the contributor payment request on Alchemy at the end of your work period, request 0.1333% REP for the third month of work.
Contributors that have already completed their first 3 months with DXdao: You will request one (1) month of REP (0.1667%) in the first contributor proposal and one (1) month of REP (0.1667%) in the contributor payment request at the end of the 2-month work period, totalling two (2) months of REP. Adjust this logically if your work period is for longer or shorter than the standard 2-month period.

A single contributor may receive a maximum of 4% REP for their paid contributions to DXdao.

## Calculating Monthly Compensation For Contributor Proposals

Pick your experience Level 1 through 8, based on experience guidelines (below) and in consultation with the DXdao community.

Select Base Salary + DXD from the DXdao Compensation Table (below).

If opting for part-time work, multiply these numbers by % of time or intended hrs/week divided by 40.

Determine 50% of full salary, if during the 1 month trial period, AND determine 80% of salary for the following two (2) months for the first contributor proposal. After the first contributor proposal for 3 months of work, salary is paid at 100% rate.
