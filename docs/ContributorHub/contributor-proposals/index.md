# Contributor Proposals

___

## When to Submit a Contributor Proposal

Once a contributor proposal has been boosted, the proposal takes approximately 7 days to pass. With this time-frame in mind, a contributor should submit their proposal on Alchemy one week before they intend to be compensated for their work. It is the contributorâ€™s responsibility to submit their contributor proposals in a timely manner, and keep track of what they have been paid.

## Contributor Proposal Format -- What to Include
